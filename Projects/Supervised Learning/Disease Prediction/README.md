Over the past decade, machine learning techniques have been widely used in intelligent health systems, particularly for breast cancer diagnosis and prognosis.  Breast Cancer is one of the most common cancers globally. So with the help of Machine Learning, we can build a model to classify the type of cancer, so it will be easy for doctors to provide treatment at the right time. Early diagnosis of breast cancer can dramatically improve prognosis and chances of survival, as it can promote timely clinical treatment of patients. This is a Classification problem and the main goal is to build the model which classifies between Malignant and Benign types of Cancer.
