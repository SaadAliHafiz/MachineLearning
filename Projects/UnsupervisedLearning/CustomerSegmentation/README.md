# ****Project Statement****

Customer Segmentation is an unsupervised method of targeting the customers in order to increase sales and market goods in a better way

This project deals with real-time data where we have to segment the customers in the form f clusters using the K-Means algorithm

The data set consists of important variables like Age, Gender, annual income, etc.

With the help of the algorithms, we can easily visualize the data and can get a segmentation of each customer so that we can target the customers in the better way

Customer Segmentation is the subdivision of a market into discrete customer groups that share similar characteristics. Customer Segmentation can be a powerful means to identify unsatisfied customer needs. Using the above data companies can then outperform the competition by developing uniquely appealing products and services.

###***Advantages of Customer Segmentation***
Determine appropriate product pricing.
Develop customized marketing campaigns.
Design an optimal distribution strategy.
Choose specific product features for deployment.
Prioritize new product development efforts.

Unsupervised Learning
Unsupervised learning is a machine learning technique in which models are not supervised using a training dataset. Instead, models themselves find the hidden patterns and insights from the given data. It can be compared to learning which takes place in the human brain while learning new things. Unsupervised learning cannot be directly applied to a

regression or classification problem because, unlike supervised learning, we have the input data but no corresponding output data. The goal of unsupervised learning is to find the underlying structure of the dataset, group that data according to similarities, and represent that dataset in a compressed format.
