Customer Segmentation is an unsupervised method of targeting the customers in order to increase sales and market goods in a better way

This project deals with real-time data where we have to segment the customers in the form f clusters using the K-Means algorithm

The data set consists of important variables like Age, Gender, annual income, etc.

With the help of the algorithms, we can easily visualize the data and can get a segmentation of each customer so that we can target the customers in the better way

Customer Segmentation is the subdivision of a market into discrete customer groups that share similar characteristics. Customer Segmentation can be a powerful means to identify unsatisfied customer needs. Using the above data companies can then outperform the competition by developing uniquely appealing products and services.
