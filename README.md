# MachineLearning

In this repository, I pracice and learn to use multiple machine learning libraries in python by doing multiple projects.

* first part of this repo is related to the Machine Learning course I did and did assignments.
* Second part is related to Projects which I did by using different machine leanring Algorithms and different machone learning libraries in python.
* Third part is related to the Pytorch tutorial in which I did basics of pytorch and learned how model works and different libraries work in machine learning.
