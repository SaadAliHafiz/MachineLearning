# MachineLearning

In this repository, I praciced and learned to use multiple machine learning libraries in python by doing multiple projects.

* First part of this repo is related to the machine learning course I did, i.e. *assignments*.
* Second part is related to projects which I did, by using different machine leanring algorithms and different machine learning libraries in python.
* Third part is related to the Pytorch tutorial in which I did basics of Pytorch and learned how model and different libraries work in machine learning.
